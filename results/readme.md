## Key Observations

### 1. 🎯 Instruction Following (IFEval) Dramatically Improves
- **IFEval shows remarkable gains**, peaking at +75% at 30% pruning
- Performance remains elevated even at 60% pruning (+32.2%)
- Suggests that **The pruned model is less able to "digress" or "over-elaborate", which paradoxically helps in tasks that require following simple instructions to the letter.**
- This is a critical finding for practical deployment where instruction-following is essential

### 2. 🧠 Multi-Step Reasoning (MUSR) Also Benefits
- **MUSR improves up to +26.1%** at the optimal 40% pruning level
- Consistent improvements across all pruning levels (6-26%)
- Indicates that **compositional reasoning capabilities can be enhanced** through targeted pruning
- Complements the IFEval findings on structured task execution

### 3. 📊 Truthfulness Shows Apparent Improvement (With Caveats)
- **TruthfulQA-MC2** improves progressively: +6.7% (10%) → +23.6% (60%)
- **TruthfulQA-MC1** shows modest gains: +1.6% to +6.3%
- **Critical context**: Baseline is near-random (23.38% vs ~25% chance). At 60% pruning, multiple benchmarks collapse to chance level (ARC-C: 23.98%, MMLU: 25.54%, WinoGrande: 48.70%)
- **Most likely mechanism**: Pruning flattens probability distributions, reducing the model's confidence in popular misconceptions that are over-represented in training data. This is bias reduction, not genuine knowledge improvement (note MMLU degrades -17.9% at 60%)
- **Practical benefit**: Pruning does reduce confident misinformation, but interpret cautiously at high pruning levels

### 4. 💥 Trade-offs: Knowledge vs Processing Capabilities
**What degrades:**
- **Perplexity metrics collapse dramatically** (WikiText +2691%, Lambada +51,000% at 60%)
- **GSM8K** (math reasoning): Highly fragile, -68.9% at 40% pruning
- **MMLU** (factual knowledge): Moderate degradation, -13.6% at 40%
- **Pattern recognition** (ARC, HellaSwag): Gradual degradation (-30% to -41% at 40%)

**What improves:**
- **Instruction following** (IFEval): Up to +75%
- **Multi-step reasoning** (MUSR): Up to +26%
- **Truthfulness** (TruthfulQA): Up to +24%

This reveals a fundamental trade-off: **width pruning sacrifices general computational capacity, but improves in tasks that benefit from direct and literal responses.**.

### 5. ⭐ Optimal Configuration at 40% Pruning (140% Expansion)
- Maintains **~87% of MMLU performance**
- Achieves **+46.5% improvement in instruction following** (IFEval)
- Delivers **+26.1% improvement in multi-step reasoning** (MUSR)
- Improves **truthfulness by 14%** (TruthfulQA-MC2)
- Balances capability preservation with enhanced reasoning
- Aligns with the **140% expansion ratio** identified as optimal in the original paper
